First time I saw Simple Human 1982's artwork - A million Times - clock of clocks, I was shocked, it's so beutiful, however the 288 clocks version was so expensive, they sell for almost $500,000 dollars at that time, so I decided to make one by myself.
After 8 months of hard working - explore, learn, design, produce, aseembly, test and finally I made it. All the hardware requirements are published on https://hackaday.io/project/189332-a-million-times-288-clone
Here are the codes for running the program, including the master IC chip and slave IC chips that controls those clocks. Click the image below for video demostration.
